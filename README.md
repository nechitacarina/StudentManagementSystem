This application is based on login functionality, so only the users with correct credentials can use it. 
Every user can be either a teacher or a student. The functionalities are different depending on the type of user that is logged in.
So, if the user is connected as a student, he can see the grades on the courses he is enrolled in, the absences and their status. 
If the user is logged in as a teacher he can see the grades and students' attendance together with the status (motivated or unfounded), add grades, 
add absences and update the absence's status, but only for the students that are enrolled in the courses they are teaching.Â 
I developed this project using Java.
